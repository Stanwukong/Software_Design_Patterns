## Introduction
Design patterns for object orientated programs are divided into three broad categories listed below. These are the same
categories used by GoF in their seminal work on design patterns.

* Creational
* Structural
* Behavioural

Each of these are explained below

## Creational
Creational design patterns relate to how objects are constructed from classes. New-ing up objects may sound trivial but
unthoughtfully littering code with object instance creations can lead to headaches down the road. The creational design
pattern come with powerful suggestions on how best to encapsulate the object creation process in a program.

* Builder Pattern
* Prototype Pattern
* Singleton Pattern
* Abstract Factory Pattern

## Structural
Structural patterns are concerned with the composition of classes i.e. how the classes are made up or constructed. These 
include: 

* Adapter Pattern
* Bridge Pattern
* Composite Pattern
* Decorator Pattern
* Facade Pattern
* Flyweight Pattern
* Proxy Pattern

## Behavioural
Behavioural patterns are concerned with the interaction of classes and objects amongst each other and the delegation
of responsibility. These include:

* Interpreter Pattern
* Template Pattern
* Chain of Responsibility Pattern
* Command Pattern
* Iterator Pattern
* Mediator Pattern
* Memento Pattern
* Observer Pattern
* State Pattern
* Strategy Pattern
* Visitor Pattern

## Examples
For most of the patterns, we'll borrow concepts from the avaiation industry to create our examples. You'll find
the course regularly talking about F-16s and Boeings to elaborate aspects of the pattern under discussion.

## For Interview Prep
For folks, who are rushing through the course for an upcoming interview, I would suggest going through all the
**creational design patterns, deccorator, proxy, iterator, observer** and **visitor** patterns. As you read through them, be sure to look at the JavaScript framework's api examples pointed out in each lesson.
