## Why Patterns?
Why do we need patterns? The blunt answer is we don't want to reinvent the wheel!
Problems that occur frequently enough in tech life usually have well-defined solutions,
which are flexible, modular and more understandable. These solutions when abstracted
away from the tactical details become design patterns. If you experienced a déjà vu feeling
when designing a solution for a problem that felt eerily similar to the solution of a previous
problem, albeit in a different domain, then you were probably using a pattern unknowingly.

Below is an image showing the relationship among the various design patterns as
explained by the seminal design patterns work done by the gang of four.
