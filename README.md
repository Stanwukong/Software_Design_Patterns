# Software Design Patterns: Best Practices for Software Developers

## Course Overview
Being good at problem-solving is one thing but to take your career to the next level, 
one must know how complex software projects are architected. Software design patterns 
provide templates and tricks used to design and solve recurring software problems and 
tasks. Applying time-tested patterns result in extensible, maintainable and flexible 
high-quality code, exhibiting superior craftsmanship of a software engineer. Being 
well-versed in knowledge of design patterns allows one to spot brittle and immature code 
from miles away. The course goes to great lengths to lay bare the esoteric concepts of 
various design patterns before the reader and is replete with real-world examples and sample code.
The readership for this course is expected to be familiar with some object orientated language. 
The course examples and snippets are written in the Java language but folks with experience 
in other OOP languages should easily be able to follow the discussion and code intent.
